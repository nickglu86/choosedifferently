                        <p>I am an American currently living in Tel Aviv for the past 3 years. I grew up in Los Angeles in a family that always made eating healthy and working out a priority. I have been surrounded by family members who have always valued health, wellness, physical activity and education. Above that, I have been surrounded by loved ones who have gone through some very trying medical or health conditions, which has always made me curious about what is actually in my food. With all of the options we currently have, and oftentimes limited regulations, education is incredibly helpful in understanding what we are eating and how we can choose the best option for ourselves.</p>
                        <p>Los Angeles has an intense diet and health culture making almost any product available to you within a 5-10 minute drive. The demand in Israel is not exactly the same, and therefore I have found myself seeking the better option and researching how to do so. Accessibility is definitely not that same here as in Los Angeles, but that does not need to stop anyone from understanding how to make simple yet effective decisions to help their unique health journey.</p>   
                        <p>Choose Differently was created to give people the tools, education, and suggestions to help them steer their health journey in the direction they would like to succeed. This is not a one size fits all, and this is not to say everyone should live exactly the same. This is exactly the opposite of that, everyone should feel the freedom to make their own, educated choices that promote the health they want to see in their own life. 
                        </p>
